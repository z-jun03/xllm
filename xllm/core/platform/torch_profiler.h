// TorchProfiler drives online timeline collection through libtorch's in-process
// Kineto profiler (the C++ equivalent of torch.profiler.profile). Unlike the
// CUDA-profiler capture-range path (see CudaProfiler), this backend records CPU
// and device activities (CUDA or MUSA PrivateUse1) itself and, on stop(),
// writes a Chrome trace JSON to disk
// without needing an external profiler such as nsys attached. This mirrors
// vLLM's default TorchProfilerWrapper so that simply launching the server with
// --enable_online_profile=true and driving /start_profile and /stop_profile
// produces a timeline.
//
// xLLM runs one worker thread per device inside a single process and Kineto /
// CUPTI is process-global, so the profiler is wrapped in a process-wide
// singleton: the first start() opens the collection window for the whole
// process and repeated / overlapping start()/stop() calls are made idempotent
// under a mutex.
//
// IMPORTANT: Kineto captures CPU operators via thread-local RecordFunction
// callbacks, so start() and stop() must be invoked on the same thread that runs
// the model forward pass for the host-side timeline to be complete. CUDA kernel
// activities are collected process-globally via CUPTI regardless of thread.
