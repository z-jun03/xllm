// `kv_caches`, then record each op's outcome into `validity_mask`. The
// caller sizes `validity_mask` to the active batch and pre-fills it with
// the kv-cache default; this helper only overrides the entries it must:
//   - RESTORED:  a checkpoint was copied into the live slot -> set 1 (warm).
//   - COLD_START: a restore was requested but the checkpoint was unavailable
//     (miss / out-of-range / copy failure) -> set 0, so the forward does not
//     treat reused kv blocks as warm recurrent state.
//   - no restore requested (continued request / no prefix reused) -> left
//     untouched, so warm continued requests keep the kv-cache default.
// Slot ownership and LRU eviction live in the scheduler-side
// LinearStateBlockManager; this helper is purely the worker-side restore copy
// that cache dictates. Saves require no worker-side copy and are handled by
// promotion in the scheduler, so this API only covers restores. Copies are
// enqueued on whichever stream is current at the call site (today this is the
// worker's dedicated `prepare_stream_`, not the default model-forward stream);
// the caller is responsible for inserting a stream-event barrier before the
// model forward consumes the restored slots — see worker_impl.cpp where
// prepare_stream.record_event() is awaited prior to the forward.
