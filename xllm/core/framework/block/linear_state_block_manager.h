// Inherits BlockManagerImpl for the slot id pool and prefix cache. The
// inherited prefix_cache_ serves as the checkpoint index (LRU + eviction that
// skips is_shared() slots). Hash domain is INDEPENDENT of the KV leaf — keys
// are chained per prefill chunk (Sequence::update_linear_state_hashes), not
// from KV block hashes.
//
// The id pool is unified: slot ids [1, num_slots) serve LIVE slots (held by a
// sequence under composite_blocks_[LINEAR]) AND committed CHECKPOINT slots
// (owned by prefix_cache_) interchangeably under reference counting. Slot 0 is
// the inherited padding block.

  // drive the slot pool directly and never exercise the token-based match().
  // |enable_prefix_cache| toggles the checkpoint index; when false the leaf
  // still serves live-slot allocation but skips save-rotation and returns an
  // empty allocate_shared. Composite drives this via the role-gated predicate

  //      is promoted into the checkpoint index and the sequence is rotated onto
  //      a fresh live slot.
  //   2. Then, if the sequence still lacks a live slot, acquires one.
  // A save rotates the slot with the same accounting verbs KV uses: it
  // deallocates the old slot and RETURNS the fresh one for the composite to
  // add_blocks, rather than mutating the sequence in place. Step 2 likewise
  // returns any newly acquired slot; a continued chunk that already holds its
  // slot returns nothing.

  // travel the same virtual, no downcast -- but its semantics diverge from
  // KV's: KV marks the returned blocks used and the composite adds them to the
  // sequence, whereas the checkpoint returned here is a restore SOURCE only. It
  // never enters the sequence's block vector and is never counted against
  // admission. |token_ids| is the sequence's full token span; |block_hashes|
  // carries the sequence's precomputed chained per-chunk linear-state hashes
  // (own hash domain, chunk-strided -- not the KV by-block chain), forwarded to
  // the probe; |existed_shared_blocks|/|mm_data| are unused. Reach in tokens
  // is derived from `returned.size() * block_size()` (block_size() is the
  // chunk stride), symmetric with KV/SWA. The leaf is KV-blind: the composite
  // owns the cross-leaf min + chunk alignment + KV-block clamp.

  // is +1 and it is LRU-promoted, pinned until restored). The caller
  // (composite) picks the deepest slot out as the class-A restore source and
  // never mounts LINEAR blocks into the sequence's live LINEAR vector (that
  // slot is the live, in-place-updated one). Reach in tokens is
  // `returned.size() * block_size()` where block_size() is the chunk stride;
