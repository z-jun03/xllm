"""One-shot bootstrap for NPU embedded-interpreter environment.

When running inside xLLM's C++ embedded Python interpreter on NPU,
libtorch_npu.so is already loaded and has registered TORCH_LIBRARY("triton")
during static init. A subsequent ``import torch`` would call
Library("triton", "DEF") again, raising "Only a single TORCH_LIBRARY"
RuntimeError.

This module patches torch.library.Library to absorb the duplicate registration,
then imports torch and torch_npu safely. It must be imported exactly once by the
C++ host (py_model_helper.cpp) before any other xllm.python module — never by
user code.

TODO: Remove once libtorch_npu defers the "triton" registration to Python
      (i.e. uses TORCH_LIBRARY_FRAGMENT instead of TORCH_LIBRARY).
