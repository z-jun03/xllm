"""python: Python-defined model graphs executed by xLLM's C++ worker.

The C++ ``PyCausalLM`` embeds a CPython interpreter (sharing this process'
libtorch), loads a model class from this package, streams weights into
``load_weights``, and drives ``forward`` / ``compute_logits`` each step.

Package layout follows ``models -> layers -> kernels``: :mod:`python.models`
(per-arch graphs) depend on :mod:`python.layers`, which depend on
``python.kernels``. :mod:`python.distributed` sits beside them and owns the
tensor-parallel collectives, which differ only in ProcessGroup backend.

``python.kernels`` is not a directory. One peer package per hardware platform
lives here -- ``kernels_cuda``, ``kernels_npu``, and one per platform added
later -- sharing no code and never importing each other. The import below binds
the one matching the active platform as ``kernels``, so layers and models import
a single fixed name and carry no hardware branch, and exactly one kernel package
is ever imported in a process.

This is one of the executor's two hardware branches. The other selects the
attention backend and graph runner in :mod:`python.model_executor.executor`,
where it belongs: attention backends hold state across steps and follow the
executor's lifecycle, unlike the stateless functions a kernel package exports.

The C++ worker registers ``torch.ops.xllm_ops`` before importing this package,
so the kernel package finds its operators here.
