"""Shared base for Python model-executor causal LMs.

A concrete model builds its own graph, lm_head, and config; the wiring that is
identical across models -- the weight-loading entry point and logits
computation -- lives here.

Model forward is driven by the runners owned by Python ModelExecutor;
PyCausalLM no longer calls model.forward() directly.
