## Code Style Guide

* Before editing, creating, refactoring, or reviewing any file under `xllm/`, you **MUST** read [custom-code-style.md](.agents/skills/code-review/references/custom-code-style.md).
* The file above is a **required instruction file**, not an optional reference. Do not skip reading it.
* Apply the rules in [custom-code-style.md](.agents/skills/code-review/references/custom-code-style.md) to **both code generation and code review**.
* Follow DDD (Domain Driven Design) principles, and keep the codebase clean and maintainable.
* If [custom-code-style.md](.agents/skills/code-review/references/custom-code-style.md) specifies a rule, that rule takes precedence over the Google C++/Python Style Guide.
* Use the Google C++/Python Style Guide only for cases not specified in [custom-code-style.md](.agents/skills/code-review/references/custom-code-style.md).

## Review Instructions

* For code review tasks, you **MUST** first read [code-review/SKILL.md](.agents/skills/code-review/SKILL.md).
* Then read [custom-code-style.md](.agents/skills/code-review/references/custom-code-style.md) and apply it during the review.
* Review code changes for quality, security, performance, correctness, and maintainability following the project-specific standards.
* Review code changes for DDD (Domain Driven Design) principles, and keep the codebase clean and maintainable.
* Use the review workflow, checklist, severity rules, and output format defined in [code-review/SKILL.md](.agents/skills/code-review/SKILL.md).
* Apply the Google C++/Python Style Guide only when the project-specific style guide does not define the rule.
* Focus the review on the requested diff or changed files. Do not comment on unrelated code.
