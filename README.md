## Acknowledgment

This project was made possible thanks to the following open-source projects:  
- [ScaleLLM](https://github.com/vectorch-ai/ScaleLLM) - xLLM draws inspiration from ScaleLLM's graph construction method and references its runtime execution. 
- [Mooncake](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake) - Build xLLM hybrid KV cache management based on Mooncake.
- [brpc](https://github.com/apache/brpc) - Build high-performance http service based on brpc.
- [tokenizers-cpp](https://github.com/mlc-ai/tokenizers-cpp) - Build C++ tokenizer based on tokenizers-cpp.
- [safetensors](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors) - xLLM relies on the C binding safetensors capability.
- [Partial JSON Parser](https://github.com/promplate/partial-json-parser) - Implement xLLM's C++ JSON parser with insights from Python and Go implementations.
- [concurrentqueue](https://github.com/cameron314/concurrentqueue) - A fast multi-producer, multi-consumer lock-free concurrent queue for C++11.
