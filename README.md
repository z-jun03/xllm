## 1. Project Overview

**xLLM** is an efficient and user-friendly LLM intelligent inference framework that provides enterprise-level service guarantees and high-performance engine computing capabilities for model inference on domestic AI accelerators.


#### Background

LLM with parameter scales ranging from tens of billions to trillions are being rapidly deployed in core business scenarios such as intelligent customer service, real-time recommendation, and content generation. Efficient support for domestic computing hardware has become a core requirement for low-cost inference deployment. Existing inference engines struggle to effectively adapt to the architectural characteristics of dedicated accelerators like domestic chips. Performance issues such as low utilization of computing units, load imbalance and communication overhead bottlenecks under the MoE architecture, and difficulties in kv cache management have restricted the efficient inference of requests and the scalability of the system. The xLLM inference engine improves the resource efficiency of the entire  "communication-computation-storage" performance link and it provides crucial technical support for the large-scale implementation of LLM in real-world business scenarios.

## 2. Core Features

**xLLM** delivers robust intelligent computing capabilities. By leveraging hardware system optimization and algorithm-driven decision control, it jointly accelerates the inference process, enabling high-throughput, low-latency distributed inference services.

**Full Graph Pipeline Execution Orchestration**
- Asynchronous decoupled scheduling at the requests scheduling layer, to reduce computational bubbles.
- Asynchronous parallelism of computation and communication at the model graph layer, overlapping computation and communication.
- Pipelining of heterogeneous computing units at the operator kernel layer, overlapping computation and memory access.

**Graph Optimization for Dynamic Shapes**
- Dynamic shape adaptation based on parameterization and multi-graph caching methods to enhance the flexibility of static graph.
- Controlled tensor memory pool to ensure address security and reusability.
- Integration and adaptation of performance-critical custom operators (e.g., *PageAttention*, *AllReduce*).

**Kernel Optimization**
- *GroupMatmul* optimization to improve computational efficiency.
- *Chunked Prefill* optimization to support long-sequence inputs.

**Efficient Memory Optimization**
- Mapping management between discrete physical memory and continuous virtual memory.
- On-demand memory allocation to reduce memory fragmentation.
- Intelligent scheduling of memory pages to increase memory reusability.
- Adaptation of corresponding operators for domestic accelerators.

**Global KV Cache Management**
- Intelligent offloading and prefetching of KV in hierarchical caches.
- KV cache-centric distributed storage architecture.
- Intelligent KV routing among computing nodes.

**Algorithm-driven Acceleration**
- Speculative decoding optimization to improve efficiency through multi-core parallelism.
- Dynamic load balancing of MoE experts to achieve efficient adjustment of expert distribution.

## 4. Quick Start
#### Installation
First, download the image we provide:
```bash
docker pull xllm/xllm-ai:xllm-0.6.0-dev-hb-py3.11-oe24.03-lts
```
Then create the corresponding container:
```bash
sudo docker run -it --ipc=host -u 0 --privileged --name mydocker --network=host  --device=/dev/davinci0  --device=/dev/davinci_manager --device=/dev/devmm_svm --device=/dev/hisi_hdc -v /var/queue_schedule:/var/queue_schedule -v /mnt/cfs/9n-das-admin/llm_models:/mnt/cfs/9n-das-admin/llm_models -v /usr/local/Ascend/driver:/usr/local/Ascend/driver -v /usr/local/Ascend/add-ons/:/usr/local/Ascend/add-ons/ -v /usr/local/sbin/npu-smi:/usr/local/sbin/npu-smi -v /usr/local/sbin/:/usr/local/sbin/ -v /var/log/npu/conf/slog/slog.conf:/var/log/npu/conf/slog/slog.conf -v /var/log/npu/slog/:/var/log/npu/slog -v /export/home:/export/home -w /export/home -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh  -v /var/log/npu/profiling/:/var/log/npu/profiling -v /var/log/npu/dump/:/var/log/npu/dump -v /home/:/home/  -v /runtime/:/runtime/  xllm/xllm-ai:xllm-0.6.0-dev-hb-py3.11-oe24.03-lts
```

Install official repo and submodules：
```
git clone https://github.com/jd-opensource/xllm
cd xllm 
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
When compiling, `vcpkg` will be downloaded by default. Alternatively, you can download `vcpkg` in advance and then set the environment variable:
```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
export VCPKG_ROOT=/your/path/to/vcpkg
```
Install python dependencies:
```
cd xllm
pip install -r cibuild/requirements-dev.txt -i https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/pypi/web/simple
pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
```

#### Compilation
When compiling, generate executable files `build/xllm/core/server/xllm` under `build/`:
```
python setup.py build
```
Or, compile directly using the following command to generate the whl package under `dist/`:
```
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

#### Launch
Run the following command to start xLLM engine: 
```
./build/xllm/core/server/xllm \    # launch xllm server
    --model=/path/to/your/llm  \   # model path（to replace with your own path）
    --backend=llm \                # indicate the LLM backend
    --port=9977 \                  # set service port to 9977
    --max_memory_utilization 0.90  # set the maximal utilization of device memory
```
